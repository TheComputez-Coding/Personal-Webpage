                <p> 
                    This website is mainly to promote my youtube channel,<br>
                    which you can subscribe to by going into <br>
                    the socials tab and clicking on YouTube.<br> 
                    I also promote some future games that I am going<br>
                    to make, and am even going to make the best one playable<br>
                    on the website. Please enjoy, and give me feedback on what to do<br>
                    in the contacts tab.
                </p>

                <div class="heading"> <h1>How this was made</h1> </div>

                <p>
                    I made this website in visual studio code, <br>
                    and it was pretty fun. Yes, for you to see this<br>
                    I had to pay a couple of bucks, but<br>
                    at least I get to make my own website!<br>
                    It was made with Visual Studio Code, and was<br>
                    coded with(most obviously) html and css. <br>
                    This took me about 1 day so far, and it was<br>
                    pretty fun making it so far.
